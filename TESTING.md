## **Testing Throughout Development**

### **Manual Testing Methods**

During the development
(print statements)

(python3)

(python3 run.py)

([Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit))

([Replit](https://replit.com/~))

### **Input Testing**

(python3 run.py)

(ValueErrors - entering everything wrong on purpose)

(attempt at using getpass)

### **Game Logic Testing**

(print statements)

(where logic relied on input, but input not possible due to bugs/not being defined yet: [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit))

## **Notable Bugs and Fixes**

(incorrectly placed print statement)

(incorrectly placed return statement)

(graphics displaying weirdly due to backslashes)

('None' after graphics due to wrapping functions in print())

(play_again() bug where any input led to 'Enter Your Prediction:')

(similar bug with exit game where break was not added)

## **Post Development Testing**

### **Validation**

(code linter)

### **Unresolved Bugs**

(linter issues due to line length, unavoidable due to most of it being code rather than output)

### **Testing Final Deployed Version**

(mention increased frequency in commits & pushes)

(asking friends to test on local machines & deployed version)

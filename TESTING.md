## **Testing Throughout Development**

### **Manual Testing Methods**

During the development of this project, I used a number of methods to manually test my code as I went.

(print statements)

(python3)

(python3 run.py)

([Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit))

([Replit](https://replit.com/~))

### **Input Testing**

(python3 run.py)

(ValueErrors - entering everything wrong on purpose)

(attempt at using getpass)

### **Game Logic Testing**

(print statements)

(where logic relied on input, but input not possible due to bugs/not being defined yet: [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit))

## **Notable Bugs and Fixes**

Encountering bugs when developing a program in a language such as Python is certainly to be expected, and I encountered a great many of them during the development of this game. Most of the time, these bugs were due to indentation errors, spelling errors, trying to import functions from other files (such as graphics.py) incorrectly, giving functions the wrong arguments (or none at all, when there should have been one), etc. I considered these as to be expected during the development process, so did not make note of them. However, below I have listed some bugs that I did keep record of, because I felt that they all served as noteworthy learning opportunities!

(incorrectly placed print statement)

(incorrectly placed return statement)

(graphics displaying weirdly due to backslashes)

('None' after graphics due to wrapping functions in print())

(play_again() bug where any input led to 'Enter Your Prediction:')

(similar bug with exit game where break was not added)

## **Post Development Testing**

### **Validation**

(code linter)

### **Unresolved Bugs**

(linter issues due to line length, unavoidable due to most of it being code rather than output)

### **Testing Final Deployed Version**

(mention increased frequency in commits & pushes)

(asking friends to test on local machines & deployed version)

# **MasterCode**

## **Application Overview**

MasterCode is a terminal-based, code breaker game based on [_Mastermind_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>), originally created by Mordecai Meirowitz.

The game itself is faithful to the traditional rules of _Mastermind_ - a secret code of 4 colours is randomly generated from a selection of 6 different colours, and concealed from the player. The player is then given 12 attempts to guess the secret code. If the player succeeds, they win! But if they do not, they lose. Duplicate colours are allowed, which adds to the overall difficulty of the game.

The style of the game is inspired by classic text-based adventure role-playing games, and thematically borrows from - and serves as an homage to - Nintendo's magnificent and iconic [_The Legend of Zelda_](https://zelda.com/about/) franchise. I chose the name 'MasterCode' due to its similarity to both _Mastermind_ (by which most people would recognise this style of game), and of course to the famous _Master Sword_ wielded by the hero of Hyrule himself.

When creating this game, I really wanted to focus on recreating the light-hearted (to a fashion!), whimsical feel of some older text-based adventure games, as well as beloved classics from _The Legend of Zelda's_ titles such as _Ocarina of Time_, which remains one of my favourite entries in the franchise. Overall, I like to hope that this game will be experienced with the same charmed sense of humour that I felt when making it.

## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience**

This game has been created with a wide target audience in mind. _Mastermind_, and similar games sharing the same core concepts, is a classic that is suitable for all ages. According to Hasbro, who currently hold the trademarks for _Mastermind_, the game is suitable for ages 8 and above. Naturally, this is a terminal-based game and is unlikely to be something children would happen upon organically, however (with adult supervision at a computer), this game would be suitable, as Hasbro indicate, for children aged 8 and above.

The addition of the text-based adventure elements, and inclusion of _The Legend of Zelda_-inspired features, also opens this game up to audiences who are interested in one or both of these things, with a taste for nostalgic or 'retro' gaming formats.

### **User Stories**

As a user:

- I would like to play a fun and engaging code breaker game based on _Mastermind_, with retro RPG elements.
- I wish to clearly see what game I am playing.
- I wish to have the choice to play the game straight from the menu.
- I need to be able to access the instructions for the game directly from the menu, should I have need of them.
- I want to see the legendary Triforce!
- When playing the game, I would like to see the visual representation of my guesses.
- When I have entered my guess, I want to see how many colours in my guess were correct and in the right position, and how many were correct but in the wrong position, so that I can advance the game without being in the dark.
- I want to be reminded of how many attempts I have remaining.
- I wish for enjoyable graphics that represent whether I won the game or lost the game.
- I want to be able to exit the game from the menu.

# **MasterCode**

## **Application Overview**

MasterCode is a terminal-based, code breaker game based on Hasbro's _Mastermind_.

The style of the game is inspired by classic text-based adventure role-playing games, and thematically borrows from - and serves as an homage to - Nintendo's magnificent and beloved _The Legend of Zelda_ franchise. I chose the name 'MasterCode' due to its similarity to both _Mastermind_ (by which most people would recognise this game), and of course to the famous _Master Sword_ wielded by the hero of Hyrule himself.

When creating this game, I really wanted to focus on recreating the light-hearted, whimsical feel of some older text-based adventure games (for the most part!), as well as beloved classics from _The Legend of Zelda's_ titles such as _Ocarina of Time_, which remains one of my favourite entries in the franchise.
